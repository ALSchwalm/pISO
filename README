Building with docker
--------------------

Just have docker installed and run:

    ./build.sh

Building without docker
-----------------------

Without docker, you will need to first ensure you have all of the appropriate
dependencies installed (see [this list](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement)).

    cd buildroot
    make xconfig
    # Select 'open' and choose 'configs/raspberrypi0_defconfig'
    # save
    make

Either approach should produce a file in `buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img`.
